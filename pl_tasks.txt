Log of changes from 3/30

refactoring retrieveMarkets.getCurrentPrice()
unlocked eu.calcPL()
amended accounts.calcUPL()

realized/unrealized profit and loss is a combination of eu.calcPL(), tradeManager.sortTrades()

test the p/l functions:
rm.getCurrentPrice() must return a list of nested dictionaries where the key is the ticker... the values contains bid, ask, last
eu.selectExecPrice calls rm.getCurrentPrice(), but this requires a portfolio of trades in the ass1_accountsClass

eu.calcPL() requires an account object

ensure that trade execution is not negatively effected by making a trade
